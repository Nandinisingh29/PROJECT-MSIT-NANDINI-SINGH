Tech. program is 480, divided in 8 sections under 6 different branches of engineering. The Department of BSH is multidisciplinary, housing four different domains together namely Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Humanities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Department mainly takes care of engineering students in their first year of the UG program. Aspiring young engineers, after their long stint of school life, get their initial experience of college life and a careful guidance for a successful transition here. The main focus of the department is to develop among the students, a sound foundation of basic scientific principles, which enables them to understand their core engineering courses, offered in higher semesters. The Department further ensures that the students develop acumen for the English language, enabling them to logically think and converse in the language. The Department actively encourages students to display their individual talents in art, culture, debates, group discussions and other extra -curricular activities.
