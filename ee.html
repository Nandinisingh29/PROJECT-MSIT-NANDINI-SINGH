    <br>
    <p>The Department of Electrical Engineering established in the year 2002 offers four years Under Graduate program. The faculty of the department practice innovative methods in the Teaching-Learning-Process that leads to effective implementation of Outcomes-Based-Education. The asset of the department is dedicated faculties, necessary technical assistants and enthusiastic students. The curriculum takes the student through effective usage of Modern Engineering Tools like: Matlab, ETAP, PLC, simulation tools. The department has strong interactions with relevant industries, and their contribution is reflected in through guidance in curriculum design, organization of industrial visits, conduction of expert lectures, organization of workshops.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All faculties actively pursue research in core-domain and in the domain of Engineering Education. The In-House Projects carried out by the students in the department under the guidance of faculty members help students to be at per with recent trends of technological advancements. The department prepares the graduating engineers so that they are able to pursue a successful professional career. The quality of the graduating students is reflected in good on-campus/off-campus recruitments. A significant number of our graduates pursue higher education in Engineering/ Management in prestigious Universities in India and outside India.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The department has two student branch chapters:  IEEE Power Energy Society and IEEE Signal Processing Society. Both the student Branch Chapters plan activities keeping in mind to make students aware of industry practices. In line with this, workshops had been organized on PLC, Application of Python in Electrical Engineering, Application of MATLAB in Electrical Engineering, IOT etc. Students are also being trained on Application of Python in data Analytics, PCB design etc. </p>
